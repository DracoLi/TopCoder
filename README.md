# Draco solves TopCoder algorithm problems

I suck at algorithm questions. Thus I am solving TopCoder problems to practice.

Right now I'm only solving Div 2 (200, 500) problems. Will be moving on to the Div 2 (1000) and then Div 1 (200, 500) once I can get 90% success rate with at least 20% above average score (determined by time used) on my current 200 and 500 problems.
